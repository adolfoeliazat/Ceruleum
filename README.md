Description
------
Ceruleum is intended to be used as a background tool during coding sessions.
As you work on the next PR, jumping around different parts of the codebase can make it hard
to keep track of all your changes (variable name, constant value, function signatures, etc).
Keep Ceruleum open as a background app and use a keyboard shortcut to quickly toggle it into view to get an
overview of the changes made.

It's basically a live diff viewer of files staged in version control.

Usage
---------
- `git add` the files you intend to commit
- Open Ceruleum, toggle focus with Command+X.

TODO
---
- Onboarding
- Night/day mode
